This project captures a variety of extensions related to [Alfresco](http://www.alfresco.org/) WCM's deployment functionality.  Specifically it contains (or will contain) custom Alfresco v3.2 Deployment Targets for the following systems:
  * [Apache CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org/)
  * [eXist](http://exist.sourceforge.net/)
  * [Apache SOLR](http://lucene.apache.org/solr/)
  * [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/)

(more will likely be added at a later date)

It also contains an Alfresco v3.0+ "timed deployment" feature, which can be configured to deploy the latest snapshot in the staging sandbox of any Web Project on a regular schedule.  For more information on this module, please refer to the [README file](http://code.google.com/p/alfresco-wcm-deployment/source/browse/trunk/timed-deployment/README.txt).

Note: this project supersedes the code current hosted at http://forge.alfresco.com/projects/wcm-deployment/
