Description
-----------
This project captures a variety of extensions related to Alfresco WCM's
deployment functionality.

Specifically it contains (or will contain) custom Alfresco v3.2 Deployment
Targets for the following systems:

    * Apache CouchDB
    * eXist
    * Apache SOLR
    * MongoDB <- IN PROGRESS

(more will likely be added at a later date)

It also contains an Alfresco v3.1+ "timed deployment" feature, which can be
configured to deploy the latest snapshot in the staging sandbox of any Web
Project on a regular schedule.

Please don't hesitate to contact the authors if you'd like to contribute!
