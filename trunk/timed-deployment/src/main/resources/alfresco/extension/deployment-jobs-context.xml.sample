  <!--
   * TIMED DEPLOYMENT JOB(S)
   *
   * To configure one or more timed deployment jobs, replace [webProjectDNSName] in the bean id with a non-whitespace symbolic name
   * for your Web Project (any value is allowed, but for simplicity the DNS name of your Web Project is recommended), then replace
   * the other configuration properties (defined in the "jobDataAsMap" property) as follows:
   *
   *  - transactionService:          the reference to the Alfresco transaction service. Shouldn't normally be modified.
   *  - webProjectDeploymentService: the reference to the underlying web project deployment service. Shouldn't normally be modified.
   *  - webProjectNodeRef:           the node ref of the Web Project that this job will operate against.
   *                                 You can find this out by looking at the properties of the Web Project in the Explorer UI.
   *  - webProjectDNSName:           the DNS name of the Web Project that this job will operate against.
   *
   * Note that only webProjectNodeRef OR webProjectDNSName should be provided, never both.
   *
   * The frequency of the job (ie. how often it runs) can be configured via the cronExpression property.  The allowed values for this
   * property are described in more detail at http://www.opensymphony.com/quartz/wikidocs/CronTriggers%20Tutorial.html.
   *
   * Finally, you may configure multiple instances of this bean (with different ids) if you wish to configure timed deployment for multiple Web
   * Projects.  In this case you may also configure different schedules for each of those Web Projects.

   *  - webProjectDNSName:                        the DNS name of the Web Project that this job will operate against.
   *  - maxReportsToPrunePerBatch:                (optional) the maximum number of deployment reports to prune in a single run (default is 100).
   *
   * Note that only webProjectNodeRef OR webProjectDNSName should be provided, never both.
